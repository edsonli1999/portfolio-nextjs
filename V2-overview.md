# Portfolio Website - Storyline Mode (V2)

## Overview

Storyline Mode is an alternative interactive viewing experience for your portfolio website that transforms the traditional portfolio format into an immersive, narrative-driven journey. This feature will allow visitors to explore your professional background, projects, and personal information through a cinematic lens, creating a memorable and unique user experience that showcases both your technical skills and creative personality.

The storyline mode will be togglable, allowing users to switch between the standard professional view and the immersive storyline experience. This preserves the functionality of your current portfolio while adding an engaging alternative that will make your site stand out.

## Potential Themes

### 1. Detective Investigation

Transform your portfolio into a detective's case file where the visitor takes on the role of an investigator:

- **Visual Style**: Film noir aesthetics with black and white imagery
- **Navigation**: Opening folders, flipping through file cabinets, examining photographs pinned to a bulletin board
- **Content Presentation**:
  - Resume/experiences as police reports or witness statements
  - Projects as evidence folders with photographs and documentation
  - Skills represented as detective's notes on your capabilities
  - Personal information as handwritten notes in a detective's notebook
- **Interactive Elements**: Magnifying glass hover effect, paper shuffling sounds, typewriter text animations

### 2. Post-Apocalyptic Terminal

Present your portfolio as a recovered database on an ancient terminal in a high-tech yet deteriorated future:

- **Visual Style**: Retro-futuristic terminal interface with neon green text, scan lines, and occasional glitches
- **Typography**: Monospaced fonts like Cascadia Code
- **Navigation**: Command-line style interface with terminal commands to access different sections
- **Content Presentation**:
  - Experience as recovered personnel files
  - Projects as archived digital artifacts
  - Skills displayed as system capability scans
  - About section as a recovered personal log
- **Interactive Elements**: Typing sounds, loading bars, artificial system responses, "decrypting" animations
